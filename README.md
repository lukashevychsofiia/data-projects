# Spam Text Classification Model

## Project Overview

This project involves the development and evaluation of a machine learning model for classifying text messages as spam or not spam. The model is built using Python and uses various natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms. The main goal is to achieve high accuracy in identifying spam messages, which can be critical for applications in email filtering, SMS filtering and other text-based communication platforms.
